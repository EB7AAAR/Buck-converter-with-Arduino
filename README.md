# Buck-converter-with-Arduino
Buck converter code for Arduino mega with feedback and PWM
The code is for a buck converter using Arduino mega
a potentiometer connected to pin A0 sets the output voltage
a feedback voltage from output is fed into pin A1 and be compared with the set value
digital pin 4 produce PWM signal based on the comparison between feedback and set value
